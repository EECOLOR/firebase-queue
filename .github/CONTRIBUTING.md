## <a name="issue"></a>Think you found a bug?

Yeah, we're definitely not perfect!

Search through [old issues](https://github.com/kaliberjs/firebase-queue/issues) before submitting a
new issue as your question may have already been answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, [open a new issue](https://github.com/kaliberjs/firebase-queue/issues/new).
Please use the provided bug report template and include a minimal repro.

If you are up to the challenge, [submit a pull request](#submit) with a fix!


## <a name="feature"></a>Have a feature request?

Great, we love hearing how we can improve our products! After making sure someone hasn't already
requested the feature in the [existing issues](https://github.com/kaliberjs/firebase-queue/issues),
go ahead and [open a new issue](https://github.com/kaliberjs/firebase-queue/issues/new). Feel free
to remove the bug report template and instead provide an explanation of your feature request.
Provide code samples if applicable. Try to think about what it will allow you to do that you can't
do today? How will it make current workarounds straightforward? What potential bugs and edge cases
does it help to avoid?


## <a name="submit"></a>Want to submit a pull request?

Sweet, we'd love to accept your contribution! [Open a new pull request](https://github.com/kaliberjs/firebase-queue/pull/new/master)
and fill out the provided form.

**If you want to implement a new feature, please open an issue with a proposal first so that we can
figure out if the feature makes sense and how it will work.**

Make sure your changes pass our linter and the tests all pass on your local machine. We've hooked
up this repo with continuous integration to double check those things for you.

All changes should should be preceded by a test. First create a failing test to show the feature is
not implemented, then write the code. If you aren't sure how to add tests, feel free to submit
regardless and ask us for some advice.
